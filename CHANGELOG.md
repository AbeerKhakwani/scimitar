# 1.1.0 (2021-09-14)

* Implement case insensitivity for attributes (fixes [issue #7](https://github.com/RIPGlobal/scimitar/issues/7)).

# 1.0.3 (2020-03-24)

* More robust path filter parsing for `PATCH` operations; previously, a path filter such as `value eq "Something With Spaces"` would have been rejected.

# 1.0.2 (2020-03-24)

* Add Travis support for CI.
* Adjust `scimitar.gemspec` a bit more for CI and now that we're public in RubyGems, with a `Gemfile.lock` bump on Scimitar itself (overlooked in 1.0.1).

# 1.0.1 (2020-03-24)

* Added source code link to `scimitar.gemspec` metadata for RubyGems.

# 1.0.0 (2020-03-24)

* Initial public release.
